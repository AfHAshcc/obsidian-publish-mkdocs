# Publish Obsidian Notes with MkDocs (template)

## How to get started?

1. Create a new github repository using [this template](https://github.com/jobindj/obsidian-mkdocs/generate)
2. Clone the repository you generated into your Obsidian folder.
3. Move the notes you would like to make public to the `/docs` folder.
4. Commit and push the changes. Github actions will publish your notes using MkDocs, with the Material theme. Your public notes will be available at `<https://username.github.io/obsidian-mkdocs/>`
